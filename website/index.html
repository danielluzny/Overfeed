            <h5>Vision Statement</h5>
            <p>The Overfeed game is a way to spend time when players are looking to occupy themselves.
                It does this through an addictive food serving themed cookie clicker game that increases in scale exponentially over time.
                Players will be able to view their progress in the form of food made and achievements unlocked.<br><br>
                Players will start off as a cook making one meal each time they click on the screen.
                Each meal sold will increase the money they have to spend.
                This enables them to buy upgrades in the form of more food production such as a food truck or a restaurant, higher priced food because of quality ingredients,
                more workers to produce food autonomously, and more recipes to increase average meal cost and change the foods appearance.
                Eventually, players will be able to start a company that grows in size to become national, international, and perhaps even planetary.<br><br>
                The game will sate player’s boredom as they sate the world’s hunger.
                Automation allows the player to scale up production without getting carpal tunnel, and random events will give bonus opportunities to serve more meals for birthday parties,
                weddings and other occasions to grow the player’s wallet in leaps and bounds.
                The target demographic is Android users looking to kill some time and feel a sense of achievement while they are entertained.
                Basically, any person, whether a casual or experienced gamer, will be able to appreciate the game.<br><br>
                Features of Overfeed include things such as progress saving, viewing statistics, upgrading, random events, fantastic design schemes, music, a storyline, and a variety of technical options.
                These will allow users to have the most control over how they choose to play the game and deliver a satisfying experience.
                Competing click-type games will be left in Overfeed’s shadow as it takes the spotlight with stunning features, storylines and a simple, sleek, intuitive design.<br><br>
                The app will begin in early iterations with the bare bones of the game: making food, keeping track of how much has been made, and saving progress.
                Further depth will be added in the form of upgrades, the design will be improved with artwork, and music will help keep the player entertained.
                For individuals who do not want to listen to music, the option to mute will be given.
                Finally, the full game will have a storyline, random events to increase progress faster, and achievements to provide progress a sense of time as a milestone.<br><br>
                We at Overfeed will consider the game a success depending on user experience and the quality of features.
                If players can play for 10 minutes and come back to the game to serve more food and unlock more achievements after their first session, Overfeed will be successful.
                If our features are numerous, entertaining, and have minimal bugs, then we will feel proud as programmers and successful as individuals.<br><br>
                The Overflow game development plan will follow the Git Flow branching strategy of maintaining a Development branch where features are branched off of then merged back into,
                a Release branch for features that are ready in time for launch and just need bug fixes, and a Main branch for fully finished versions and hotfixes.
