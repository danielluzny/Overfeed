            <h5>Vision Statement</h5>
            <p class="w3-light-gray">The Overfeed game is a way to spend time when players are looking to occupy themselves.
                It does this through an addictive food serving themed cookie clicker game that increases in scale exponentially over time.
                Players will be able to view their progress in the form of food made and achievements unlocked.<br><br>
                Players will start off as a cook making one meal each time they click on the screen.
                Each meal sold will increase the money they have to spend.
                This enables them to buy upgrades in the form of more food production such as a food truck or a restaurant, higher priced food because of quality ingredients,
                more workers to produce food autonomously, and more recipes to increase average meal cost and change the foods appearance.
                Eventually, players will be able to start a company that grows in size to become national, international, and perhaps even planetary.<br><br>
                The game will sate player’s boredom as they sate the world’s hunger.
                Automation allows the player to scale up production without getting carpal tunnel, and random events will give bonus opportunities to serve more meals for birthday parties,
                weddings and other occasions to grow the player’s wallet in leaps and bounds.
                The target demographic is Android users looking to kill some time and feel a sense of achievement while they are entertained.
                Basically, any person, whether a casual or experienced gamer, will be able to appreciate the game.<br><br>
                Features of Overfeed include things such as progress saving, viewing statistics, upgrading, random events, fantastic design schemes, music, a storyline, and a variety of technical options.
                These will allow users to have the most control over how they choose to play the game and deliver a satisfying experience.
                Competing click-type games will be left in Overfeed’s shadow as it takes the spotlight with stunning features, storylines and a simple, sleek, intuitive design.<br><br>
                The app will begin in early iterations with the bare bones of the game: making food, keeping track of how much has been made, and saving progress.
                Further depth will be added in the form of upgrades, the design will be improved with artwork, and music will help keep the player entertained.
                For individuals who do not want to listen to music, the option to mute will be given.
                Finally, the full game will have a storyline, random events to increase progress faster, and achievements to provide progress a sense of time as a milestone.<br><br>
                We at Overfeed will consider the game a success depending on user experience and the quality of features.
                If players can play for 10 minutes and come back to the game to serve more food and unlock more achievements after their first session, Overfeed will be successful.
                If our features are numerous, entertaining, and have minimal bugs, then we will feel proud as programmers and successful as individuals.<br><br>
                The Overflow game development plan will follow the Git Flow branching strategy of maintaining a Development branch where features are branched off of then merged back into,
                a Release branch for features that are ready in time for launch and just need bug fixes, and a Main branch for fully finished versions and hotfixes.

            <h5>Demographic</h5>
            <p class="w3-light-gray">The indended users are bored Android users who enjoy playing games in their spare time, such as in a waiting room or before a class.
                The users are expected to only play for a short time and come back to play repeatedly- students, professors, and anyone visiting the DMV.

                    While I'm wait, I feel unproductive. <br>Bored. <br>Lonely on occasion. <br>However, if you can empathize with my situation, then I have good news!<br><br>

                    While not currently backed by research(as far as we are aware after deciding not to look into it),
                    pure reason dictates that hearing the low rumble of conversation and occasional laughter
                    aid in relaxing the mind, releasing stress that you don't know you have.
                    See your success as the numbers get bigger and pop-ups provide the positive
                    reinforcement needed to keep playing. You'll be feeling better in no time.

                In the beginning of the class our group stayed on top of the project, finishing with plenty of time to spare.
                We set small milestones and met them repeatedly. But over time, other classes and situations slowed everyone down in different ways, and we procrastinated
                with the iterations which came back to bite us. Especially the third iteration.<br>
                Looking back, keeping the pace going was important, and setting milestones for ourselves helped a lot.
                Biting off more than we could handle hurt pretty bad too, impacting the quality of other features.<br>
                Going forward we're all going to be practicing better time management and estimate our efficiency more accurately.
            </p>

            <p>
                The database took an ungodly amount of time. Robert spend multiple weeks researching and testing code with little in the way of results. Dan took 5 days total,
                losing out on an unhealthy amount of sleep, but was able to get it working in time for the end of the project. The largest time sink ended up being
                the research and testing. Digging through websites, stack overflow, the discussion forum and other group's projects took longest instead of coding.
                But even coding took ages because of bugs showing up whenever more code was added. It was a hellish cycle of research, experimenting, and code-like-hell.<br>
                The music feature the fastest feature to add. Developing it took time and effort but Robert started on the right track from the start.
                His experience working with audio files helped with finding resources and altering them to fit the project.<br>
                The biggest surprise was how difficult dividing simple tasks into user stories turned out to be. Often everything conflated into a strongly coupled mess.
                It probably would've been easier if there were non-technical people working on the project giving a different perspective. Too many chefs, not enough cooks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Surprisingly, the upgrades feature turned out the best. It had nice graphics because of Chris' efforts and artistic experience, as well as
                a large beneficial impact on gameplay, and interacted nicely with most of the other features. The group had expected it to turn out scuffed due
                to high coupling, but we kept it separate and it turned out great. The biggest success for that feature was multi-threading to keep different
                processes separate, preventing continuous features from being interrupted and letting timed features, including upgrades, run only when they needed to.
                of many other features.<br>
                Merging actually was a unpleasant surprise. There was a <i>hiccup</i> during the last 4 hours of iteration 1 where shit hit the fan due to some forced merges,
                reckless panic fixes, and exhaustion. The group got it fixed in time, but it took the life out of each and every one of us. It took 2 weeks to recover ourselves.
